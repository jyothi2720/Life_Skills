# Tiny Habits

## Question 1: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

* One of the most interesting ideas from the video is how a tiny action can create a big change, like BJ Fogg’s example of flossing just one tooth.

* He said you don’t need to floss all teeth—just floss one. This removes the pressure and helps you start the habit.

* This idea shows how small actions done consistently can build confidence and lead to bigger habits.

## Question 2: How can you use B = MAP to make making new habits easier? What are M, A and P.

### BJ Fogg’s formula:

#### B = MAP

Behavior happens when three things come together:

**M = Motivation**

• Your desire to do the habit

• **Example:** You want to get healthy or be productive.

**A = Ability**

• How easy the habit is to do

• If it’s simple, you will do it more.

**P = Prompt**

• A reminder or trigger that tells you to do the habit

• **Example:** alarm, seeing your shoes, after brushing teeth.

### How it helps:

**To make a habit easier:**

* If motivation is low, increase ability by making the habit tiny.

* Add good prompts so you don’t forget.

* Don’t depend fully on motivation.

## Question 3 : Why it is important to "Shine" or Celebrate after each successful completion of habit? (This is the most important concept in today's topic. Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit)

* When you celebrate, you feel **happy.**

* This happy feeling sends a message to your brain:

* **“This habit is good. Do it again!”**

* Celebration helps your brain remember the habit.

* It makes the habit stick faster and become automatic.

* You don’t need a big celebration. Small ones work.

**Main idea:**

* Whatever you celebrate becomes a habit.

## Question 4: In this video, what was the most interesting story or idea for you?

* The most interesting idea is the concept of 1% improvement every day.
* Instead of big changes, small improvements add up over time.

**Example from the video:**
* A 1% improvement each day for 1 year makes you 37 times better.
* A 1% decline each day makes you much worse.

## Question 5: What is the book's perspective about Identity?

**Atomic Habits says:**

* “The biggest change happens when you focus on who you want to become, not what you want to achieve.”

- **Identity > Outcomes.**

**Example:**

* Instead of “I want to study daily,”
* say “I am a disciplined student.”

When your identity changes, your habits naturally follow.

## Question 6: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit easier to do?

To make a habit easier, use **The Law of Least Effort:**

**1. Reduce friction –** make the habit require less effort

**Example:** Keep water bottle on your table → drink more water.

**2. Prepare your environment**

* Keep workout clothes ready the night before.

**3. Start small**

**• 2 minutes rule:** Do the habit for just 2 minutes.

**• Example:** Reading → read 1 page.

**4. Automation**

* Use reminders, apps, scheduling.

Make the habit so easy that you can't say no.

## Question 7: Write about the book's perspective on how to make a habit harder to do?

To break a bad habit, increase friction:

**1. Make the cue invisible**

Hide snacks, remove social media apps.

**2. Increase steps/friction**

**Example:**

If you want to use your phone less, keep it in another room.

**3. Make it unattractive**

**Example:**

* **Tell yourself:** “Scrolling affects my sleep, makes me tired tomorrow.”

**4. Make it unsatisfying**

**Example:**

* Have an accountability partner or penalty (₹10 fine).

* The harder the habit is, the less you do it.

## Question 8: Pick one habit that you would like to do more of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue obvious or the habit more attractive or easy and or response satisfying?

### Example Habit: Daily Reading

**Cue Obvious:**

* Keep the book on your pillow or desk.

* Set a daily alarm at 9 PM.

**Make it Attractive:**

* Choose a book you enjoy.

* Pair it with tea or relaxing music.

**Make it Easy:**

* Read for just 2 minutes or 1 page.

* Keep the book always near you.

**Make it Satisfying:**

* Tick a box on a habit tracker every day.

* Smile or say “Nice!” after completing it.

## Question 9: Pick one habit that you would like to eliminate or do less of? What are the steps that you can take to make it make the cue invisible or the process unattractive or hard or the response unsatisfying?

### Example Habit: Reduce Mobile Screen Time

**Make Cue Invisible:**

* Keep the phone in another room.

* Turn off notifications.

**Make it Unattractive:**

* Remind yourself how scrolling wastes time and reduces productivity.

**Make it Hard:**

* Log out of apps.

* Use app blockers.

* Keep the phone away from your bed.

**Make it Unsatisfying:**

* Track screen time weekly.

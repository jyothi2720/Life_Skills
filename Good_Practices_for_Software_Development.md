# Good Practices for Software Development

1. Question 1: Which point(s) were new to you?

2. Question 2: Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?


## 1. Which point(s) were new to you?

* Writing and sharing requirements even if no tool like Jira/Trello is used

* Using Loom videos, screenshots, and GitHub gists to ask better questions

* Joining meetings 5–10 minutes early to build rapport

* Writing all questions in one message instead of sending many messages

* Tracking time using apps to improve focus and productivity

## 2.Which area do you think you need to improve on? What are your ideas to make progress in that area?

**Area to improve: Communication & asking questions clearly**

**Ideas to improve:**

* Clearly explain the problem before asking for help

* Mention what I already tried to solve the issue

* Use screenshots or small code snippets when needed

* Ask questions in group channels instead of private messages

**Area to improve: Focus during work**

**Ideas to improve:**

* Keep phone on silent during work hours

* Block social media while working

* Follow “work when you work, rest when you rest”

* Try time-tracking to understand where time is spent
